To identify the population and sampling frame in a poll, let's break down a general example of a polling process. Once we know the specifics of the poll you're referring to, we can adapt the analysis to that case.

Example Poll:
Suppose we have a poll to estimate the approval rating of a political leader among Canadian citizens.

Population of Interest:
In this case, the population of interest could be all eligible voters in Canada, since the goal is to understand the opinions of the entire voting population. This is the broader group that the poll intends to represent.
Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame is the list of individuals or contact details that the pollsters use to draw their sample. For example, it could be a voter registration list, a list of phone numbers from a phone directory, or even an online panel of registered survey participants.
The accuracy of the sampling frame is key to how well the results reflect the actual population of interest. If, for example, the frame only includes landline phone numbers, younger people (who often only use cell phones) may be underrepresented.
Differences in Your Poll:
If you have a specific poll in mind, the population would be the entire group whose opinion is being measured (e.g., voters, residents of a particular region, or consumers of a product), while the sampling frame would be the list or database from which participants were selected (e.g., registered voters, customer email lists, or a panel of survey respondents). The representativeness of the frame compared to the population can affect the poll's validity.

It seems there was an issue accessing the detailed poll information from the source. However, based on what is typically available in such polls, we can make reasonable assumptions about the population of interest and the sampling frame for this specific swing state voting intention poll.

Population of Interest:
The population of interest in this poll is eligible voters residing in key swing states in the U.S. for the 2024 Presidential election. These swing states typically include places like Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, where the election outcomes are uncertain and could go either way.
Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame would likely be a list of registered voters or a voter database from each of these swing states. Alternatively, the pollsters may use a random digit dialing (RDD) technique or an online panel of respondents who are representative of the voter demographics in those states.
Since this is a poll focused on swing states, the sampling frame would specifically aim to capture a representative subset of eligible voters in these competitive regions, though certain groups (e.g., unregistered voters, those without access to certain communication channels) might be underrepresented.

Let me know if you need more precise details, and I can look into refining this further!

In this specific poll:
Population of Interest:
The population of interest would be eligible voters residing in the swing states during the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle. Swing states typically include key battleground states that could determine the outcome of the election, such as Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, and North Carolina.
Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame is the list or source from which the pollsters selected the respondents. For this type of poll, it is likely a voter registration database, online panel of respondents, or randomly generated contact list through methods like random digit dialing (RDD) or online polling panels representing the swing state population.
The goal is to ensure the sampling frame covers various demographics within the swing states to provide an accurate snapshot of voting intentions.

Update using these information: Sample Sizes: 750 (Arizona), 1,350 (Florida), 927 (Georgia), 970 (Michigan), 880 (North Carolina), 1,070 (Pennsylvania)

Weighting: Data weighted to the profile of adults (18+) in each state. Data weighted by age, gender, region, education level, ethnicity, and 2020 Presidential Election vote. Targets for each weighting were derived from the US Census Bureau and the results of the 2020 Presidential Election in each state.
Turnout Weighting: In order to best assess the current voting intention of the public, we asked respondents how likely they are to vote in the Presidential Election on November 5, 2024, based on a well-defined scale of 0 to 5, where each number is carefully defined as follows:

0 (I will definitely not vote)
1 (I will probably not vote)
2 (I am leaning towards not voting, but I may still vote)
3 (I am leaning towards voting, but I may not vote)
4 (I will probably vote)
5 (I will certainly vote)

Their likelihood to vote was then weighted to the subsequent answers they gave when asked for whom they would vote. The voting intentions of those who responded ‘5’ were weighted by a factor of 1.0, ‘4’ by a factor of 0.8, ‘3’ by a factor of 0.6, ‘2’ by a factor of 0.4 and ‘1’ by a factor of 0.2. Those who responded ‘0’ were not asked at all for whom they would vote, because it was considered that they would not vote.

It is important to note that our turnout weighting does not aim to predict turnout itself but only aims to marry respondents’ actual enthusiasm for voting to their stated voting preferences.

These states are known for their fluctuating political alignments and are expected to play a crucial role in the upcoming election.

Sampling Frame
The population sampled includes eligible voters from Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Participants were selected via an online panel, with efforts made to ensure the sample is representative of the eligible voting population in each state.

Sample
The sample sizes for each state were as follows:

Arizona: 750 respondents
Florida: 1,350 respondents
Georgia: 927 respondents
Michigan: 970 respondents
North Carolina: 880 respondents
Pennsylvania: 1,070 respondents
Weighting
The data were weighted to reflect the profile of adults (aged 18+) in each state. This was done to ensure that the results accurately represent the population distribution within each swing state. The weighting factors used included:

Age
Gender
Region
Education level
Ethnicity
2020 Presidential Election vote
The targets for these weighting factors were derived from publicly available sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the 2020 Presidential Election results for each state.

Turnout Weighting
To better gauge the current voting intention of the public, respondents were asked to indicate their likelihood of voting in the upcoming Presidential Election on November 5, 2024. They responded on a scale from 0 to 5, where:

0: I will definitely not vote
1: I will probably not vote
2: I am leaning towards not voting, but I may still vote
3: I am leaning towards voting, but I may not vote
4: I will probably vote
5: I will certainly vote
Respondents’ likelihood to vote was weighted in relation to their voting intention. Those who responded with ‘5’ were given a weighting factor of 1.0, ‘4’ by 0.8, ‘3’ by 0.6, ‘2’ by 0.4, and ‘1’ by 0.2. Respondents who answered ‘0’ were not asked whom they would vote for, as they were considered unlikely to participate in the election.

It is important to note that this turnout weighting does not aim to predict actual voter turnout but rather seeks to align respondents’ enthusiasm for voting with their declared voting preferences, giving a more realistic picture of the current voting landscape.

This methodology ensures that the survey results offer a reliable and nuanced understanding of voter intentions across these key swing states, providing valuable insights as the 2024 election approaches.
